    "In the previous section, we discussed numerical errors caused by how computers represent numbers. These are different from errors in a code, which can be classified into three different types: (1) syntax, (2) runtime, and (3) logical errors. Syntax errors occur when the code does not conform to the correct programming language syntax. Runtime errors (also called exceptions) occur when the code has no syntax errors but encounters exceptional situations. Logical errors occur when the code has no syntax or runtime errors and runs smoothly, but does not produce the intended result due to incorrect logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our programs have crashed whenever they have encountered a syntax or runtime error. However, runtime errors can be handled to allow the program to continue without crashing. In this section, we will discuss handling exceptions and debugging, which is the process of fixing bugs (i.e., errors).\n",

    "\n",
    "Errors or mistakes in a program are often referred to as **bugs**. The process of tracking them down and correcting them is called **debugging**. It is useful to distinguish between error types in order to track them down more quickly. There are three basic types of errors that can occur:\n",
    "1. Syntax errors\n",
    "2. Runtime errors\n",
    "3. Logical errors\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors occur when the syntax of a program does not conform to the rules of the language. By now, you will have encountered many syntax errors when programming for this class. Some examples of syntax errors include:\n",
    "* trying to assign a variable to a number: `1 =  x`\n",
    "* inconsistent parentheses and/or brackets: `(1]`\n",
    "* missing quotes: `print(I like programming)`\n",
    "* missing colon: `def function_name()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, syntax errors are generally easily detectable, easily found, and easily fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Runtime Errors (Exceptions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime errors, also known as exceptions, occur when something goes wrong while the program is running. Some  examples of runtime errors include:\n",
    "* division by zero: `1/0`\n",
    "* performing an operation on incompatible types: `1 + [2]`\n",
    "* using a variable which has not been defined: `print(x)`\n",
    "* trying to access an index out of range: `x = [1, 2]; x[5]`\n",
    "* trying to import a misspelled/missing module: `import mat`\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are more difficult to find and are only detectable by the interpreter when a program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Logical Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, even if there are no syntax or runtime errors, and a code runs without raising any errors, that does not necessarily mean the code is correct. Logical errors occur when the result is incorrect due to a mistake in the logic of the program. If there is a logical error, the program will run smoothly, in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but the result is incorrect. Some examples of logical errors include:\n",
    "* mixing up a variable name\n",
    "* getting operator precedence wrong\n",
    "* making a mistake in logical operations\n",
    "\n",

    "Until now, our programs have crashed whenever they have encountered a syntax or runtime error. Instead of letting the error crash our program, it would be nice if we can intercept it, handle it gracefully, and allow the program to continue. Syntax errors cannot be handled and are always fatal (a program with syntax error will always crash). However, runtime errors are not fatal – we can write our code to *handle* exceptions gracefully and allow the program to continue running instead of crashing. By handling exceptions, we can instruct our program to take alternative actions when a runtime error occurs.\n",

From 1996, Yorktown was used as the testbed for the Navy's Smart Ship program. On 21 September 1997, while on maneuvers off the coast of Cape Charles, Virginia, a crew member entered a zero into a database field, causing an attempted division by zero in the ship's Remote Data Base Manager. This error brought down all the machines on the network, causing the ship's propulsion system to fail and the ship to stop dead in the water.\n",

    "## 3.2. Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with best practices, errors will occur. So, it is important to be able to identify and fix them. Errors are often referred to as bugs, and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called debugging. One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually challenging and interesting parts of programming. In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with errors or results that are not what you expect. These are your clues to infer what led to the results you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python raises an error, look at what type of error it is to help narrow your search. Also check that you aren't making any common mistakes (e.g., spelling, missing parentheses, missing quotes, = versus ==, etc.). If the cause of the error is not obvious, there are different debugging techniques, and we discuss some of these techniques below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.1. Using `print()` \n",
    "\n",
    "When you first learn how to program, it can be hard to spot bugs in your code. One common practice is to insert `print()` statements at different lines to check how the output is changing. This will output the intermediate results which were calculated on that line. Most programmers intuitively do this as they are writing a function, or perhaps if they need to figure out why it isn't doing the right thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say the following function `f1()` keeps returning an error or incorrect result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f1(x):\n",
    "    result = f2(x)\n",
    "    return result * 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add a `print()` statement before the return to check what `f2()` is returning:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f1(x):\n",
    "    result = f2(x)\n",
    "    print('f2 result: ', result)\n",
    "    return result * 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If it turns out `result` is not what we expect it to be, we would go look in `f2()` to see if it works properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using `print()` statements for debugging, here are a few good practices to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't just print out a variable – add some sort of message to make it easier for you to read\n",
    "```python \n",
    "print(result) # harder to keep track\n",
    "print(f'f2 result: {result}') # easier\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Use `print()` statements to view the results of function calls (i.e. after function calls)\n",
    "* Use `print()` statements at the end of a loop to view the state of the counter variables after each iteration\n",
    "```python \n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < n:\n",
    "    i += f1(i)\n",
    "    print(f'counter i is {i}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Don't just put random `print()` statements after lines that are obviously correct\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print()` statements described above are meant for quick debugging of one-time errors – after figuring out the error, you would remove all the `print()` statements. However, sometimes we would like to leave the debugging code if we need to periodically test our file. It can get kind of annoying if every time we run our file, debugging messages pop up. One way to avoid this is to use a global debug variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "debug = True\n",
    "\n",
    "def f1(x):\n",
    "    result = f2(x)\n",
    "    if debug:\n",
    "        print('f2 result: ', result)\n",
    "    return result * 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, whenever we want to do some debugging, we can set the global `debug` variable to `True`, and when we don't want to see any debugging input, we can turn it to `False` (such a variable is called a \"flag\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.2. Interactive Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has functionalities that can assist you when debugging. The standard debugging tool in Python is `pdb` (Python DeBugger) for interactive debugging. It lets you step through the code line by line to find out what might be causing a difficult error. We won't cover too much about it here, you can check out the [documentation for details](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html).\n",

    "There are two ways you could debug your code, (1) activate the debugger after you run into an exception; (2) activate debugger before you run the code. Both work very similarly, so we will only demonstrate activating the debugger *after* an exception is raised.\n",
