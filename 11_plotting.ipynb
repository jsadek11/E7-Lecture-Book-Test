    "Data visualization plays a pivotal role in engineering and science, serving as a powerful tool for understanding complex data and effectively conveying results in reports, publications, presentations, and other media. Python has emerged as a popular language for data analysis and visualization, due to its versatility and an array of dedicated libraries. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of data visualization, with a primary focus on Matplotlib – the cornerstone of Python's data visualization stack. There are other popular libraries, some of which build on Matplotlib, such as Seaborn, GGplot, among others. Matplotlib is extensive, and our goal is not to cover every feature. We will cover the fundamentals of Matplotlib, which should enable you to explore other features.\n",

    "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is highly customizable and supports a wide range of plot types. The [Matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html#gallery) contains numerous example plots. Most of the Matplotlib utilities are under the *pyplot* submodule. To use *pyplot*, we need to import it first. The convention is to import Matplotlib's `pyplot` module as `plt`: `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps for creating plots using Matplotlib are:\n",
    "1. Create a Figure object\n",
    "> A Figure is a container that holds all the objects representing axes, graphics, text, and labels\n",
    "2. Create an Axes object\n",
    "> An Axes is the plotting area within the figure\n",
    "3. Plot the data\n",
    "> Various plotting functions exist for different chart types\n",

    "> Adjust labels, limits, and other aesthetics to improve clarity and presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib offers two primary approaches to creating visualizations:\n",
    "1. Explicit Axes Interface (Object-Oriented)\n",
    "    > This approach uses methods on a Figure or Axes object to build a visualization step by step. This gives you more control for customizing your plots, which is especially useful for complex plots.\n",
    "2. Implicit Pyplot Interface\n",
    "    > This approach keeps track of the most recent figure and Axes created, and plots to the object Python thinks the user wants. In this case, we rely on `pyplot` to implicitly create the Figure and Axes. This is convenient for simple, quick plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss the explicit `Axes` interface first, and then see how we can achieve similar plots using the implicit `pyplot` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Creating a Figure Object \n",
    "\n",
    "To start crafting your visualization, you will need a Figure object. We can create a new Figure object using `plt.figure()`. Each call to `plt.figure()` generates a **new** Figure object. The `plt.figure()` function has many optional parameters. A full list can be found in the [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.figure.html). Some of the optional parameters include:\n",

    "\n",
    "This creates a new figure, which acts as a single container for all the objects representing axes, graphics, text, and labels.
