    "Many engineers and scientists use MATLAB to analyze and design systems and products. MATLAB is primarily designed for numerical and matrix-based computation. There are many similarities between MATLAB and Python, so your Python experience will provide a good head start for learning MATLAB. However, there are important differences that you must learn to switch effectively from Python to MATLAB. In this section, we will explore basic MATLAB syntax concepts and demonstrate equivalent concepts in Python to ease the transition. Our goal is to highlight the MATLAB approach to topics you are already familiar with in Python.\n",

    "# 6. Iteration <a id=\"s6\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration works similarly in Python and MATLAB, but there are some differences in the syntax. Similar to conditional statements, no colon `:` should be included at the end of the line of a `for` or `while` loop. In addition, while indentation is not required in MATLAB, it is recommended for better readability. Lastly, you should use the keyword `end` to specify the end of a `for` or `while` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that in Python we can loop over the values of a data structure, its indexes, both the values and indexes, among others. However, iteration in MATLAB is not as flexible. In MATLAB, you can either directly iterate over the elements or iterate over the indexes and then use indexing to access individual values in the sequence.\n",
