    "## Question 1: Chessboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 2-D NumPy array `chess_board` representing the state of a chessboard, where each element contains information about a square. An array with random number has already been defined for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using only slicing operations and without redefining the array, modify `chess_board` to assign 0 to the light squares and 1 to the dark squares**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "1. A standard chessboard has 8 x 8 = 64 squares, top-left square is a light square and no adjacent squares have the same color type.\n",
    "2. Information about top-left square is stored in `chess_board[0,0]` and bottom-right square is in `chess_board[7,7]`\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for an example of a standard chess board and the required output array.\n",
