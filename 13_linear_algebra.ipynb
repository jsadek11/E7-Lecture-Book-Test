    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is undeniably one of the most essential mathematical tools across various fields and disciplines. Its significance lies in its ability to describe or approximate countless real-world phenomena through linear relationships. In finance, linear algebra aids in portfolio optimization, enabling investors to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Medical imaging relies on linear algebra to reconstruct detailed images from complex data obtained through MRI and CT scans. Signal processing harnesses linear algebra to enhance audio and image quality. In environmental science, researchers leverage linear algebra to model climate patterns and simulate ecological systems. Linear algebra even plays a pivotal role in determining the most relevant web pages in a Google search.\n",

    "This section provides a basic overview of some basic linear algebraic vocabulary and concepts that are important for later chapters. However, the information in this section is in no way comprehensive and should not be considered a substitute for a full linear algebra course. Rather, our goal is to focus on numerical algorithms to answer questions in linear algebra, specifically, solving a system of linear equations.\n",

Specifically, if we have two `ndarray` objects in Python of the same shape, `A * B` takes every element of $A$ and multiplies it by the corresponding element of $B$ in the same index. This is known as element-by-element multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ should be arrays of the same shape. However, this is *different* from that standard matrix multiplication in linear algebra. Below we introduce the dot product of two vectors and then discuss matrix multiplication.\n",
