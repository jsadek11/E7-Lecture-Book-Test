    "Many tasks in computing require repeating the same basic action multiple times. While humans might find doing the same thing over and over again tedious, computers are really good at executing the same instructions millions or billions of times repeatedly  with precision. This capability makes computers invaluable for automating repetitive tasks. Programming languages like Python offer direct methods for performing such repetitive tasks, a concept known as **iteration**.\n",

    "Iteration involves the process of repeatedly executing a set of statements. It's analogous to a **loop**, as it cycles back to the beginning after each iteration. In this section, we will explore two primary types of loops in Python:\n",

    "* Inside the indented code block, we place the commands that need to be repeated\n",
    "* Python will initially assign the first element of the sequence to the variable `value`, execute the indented code block, and then proceed to the next element in the sequence and execute the indented code block again.

    "# 5. List Comprehension <a id=\"s5\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern programming languages, including Python, there are more concise ways to perform iterations and create lists. One such method is **list comprehension**. List comprehensions allow you to create lists from existing sequences with a compact syntax. The basic syntax of list comprehensions is as follows:\n",
