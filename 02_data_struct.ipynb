    "# 0. Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already encountered some simple Python data types like `int`, `float`, and `bool`. These types represent a single value and cannot be subdivided. Such types are known as **scalar** objects. However, in practice, programs often need to work with collections of values. For example, consider representing daily maximum temperatures over a year. Instead of using 365 individual floats (e.g., `day1 = 63.9`, `day2 = 64.6`, `day3 = 65.0`, ...), we can use a list of floats: `temp = [63.9, 64.6, 65.0, ...]`. This approach is more powerful and efficient, allowing us to perform operations on the entire list using similar syntax to operations on scalar objects. Efficient storage and manipulation of data structures are crucial for scientific and engineering applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects that contain multiple values are called **non-scalar** objects. These objects have an internal structure that can be subdivided (e.g., accessing the first value). Due to their structured nature, they are referred to as **data structures**. Python offers many built-in data structures, such as strings, lists, and tuples, which we will encounter frequently.\n",

Here's an excerpt from the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences):\n",
    "\n",
    ">Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are **immutable**, and usually contain a **heterogeneous** sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see below) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of named tuples). Lists are **mutable**, and their elements are usually **homogeneous** and are accessed by iterating over the list.\n",

The backslash is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as the quote character.

Instead, this course is about teaching you a way of thinking and providing you with the fundamentals so you can look up appropriate documentation for any data structure you may encounter, read its documentation, and be able to successfully use it. For example another common data structure that we did not discuss is <code>dict</code>, which stands for dictionary. You can briefly read about in <a href=\"https://pythonnumericalmethods.studentorg.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter02.06-Data-Structure-Dictionaries.html\"> this documentation</a>. </div>"

    "There are other ways to format a string from a combination of data types. To insert different objects within a string, the `%` operator is used along with a letter indicating the object type we want to insert in its location. The table below lists some of the commonly used string formatting specifiers.\n",

    "| `%f`     | Floating-point real number                |                   \n",

In general, Python strings use the Unicode Standard for representing characters. This means each character in a string has a unique integer code assigned to it. When you compare strings in Python, it's these Unicode integer values that are compared.
