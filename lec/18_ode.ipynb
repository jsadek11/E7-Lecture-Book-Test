    "A differential equation is a mathematical equation that relates a function to its derivative(s). These equations emerge when the rate of change (i.e., the derivative) is related to the function itself and/or its independent variable(s). Differential equations are fundamental in almost all disciplines, with the most common examples found in physics and engineering. Consider, for example, Newton's second Law: $F=ma$, where $F$ is a force acting on an object, $m$ is the mass of the object, and $a$ is its acceleration. Recall that $a=v'=s''$, where $v$ is the velocity and $s$ is the displacement. Thus, Newton's second law can be rewritten as $F=mv'$ or $F=ms''$, both of which are differential equations. The objective when working with differential equations is to find the unknown function that satisfies the relationship between a function and its derivatives, such as determining the position of an object over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In introductory physics courses, you likely studied the motion of an object under a constant force and without friction, such as the free fall of an object under gravity, assuming no air resistance. In these simple cases, a neat analytical solution can be obtained for $a$, $v$, and $s$, as a function of time. However, this scenario is a simplification and does not accurately represent real-world conditions. It only takes minor changes, such as adding friction or considering interactions between multiple objects, for the differential equations derived from Newton's second law to become significantly more complicated and often impossible to solve using analytical methods. For example, consider the motion of an object orbiting a much heavier central body, such as the moon orbiting Earth, driven by gravitational forces. Even with just two celestial bodies, solving for the position of the moon analytically is not trivial. Now, imagine the complexity of the differential equations needed to model the interactions within our entire solar system or even our galaxy! The resulting differential equations often have no analytic solutions, and the only way to determine how the positions of the bodies evolve over time is through numerical methods.\n",

    "## 1.1. Definition of Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In various engineering and scientific disciplines, there are two main types of equations: algebraic and differential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algebraic Equations:** An algebraic equation involves basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of a variable, often with polynomials, such as $f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0$. Solving an algebraic equation means finding specific values, known as roots, that satisfy $f(x) = 0$. In this case, the unknown represents distinct numerical values for $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differential Equations:** Conversely, a differential equation relates functions and their derivatives, such as $f''(x) + 2f'(x) + f(x) = 0$. Solving a differential equation means finding the function(s) that satisfy it. Unlike algebraic equations, the unknown in a differential equation is an entire function, making the solution process more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Types of Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential equations can be classified into two main types based on the number of independent variables: ordinary and partial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):** ODEs involve an unknown function and its derivatives with respect to a *single independent variable*. An example is $f''(x) + 2f'(x) + f(x) = 0$, where there is a single independent variable $x$. In general, ODEs consider how the function varies across a single dimension, such as time or a single spatial dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):** Conversely, PDEs involve unknown functions and their partial derivatives with respect to *several independent variables*. An example is $x\\dfrac{\\partial f(x, t)}{\\partial x} + t\\dfrac{\\partial f(x, t)}{\\partial t} - f(x, t) = 0$, where there are two independent variables $x$ and $t$. In general, PDEs consider how the function varies across multiple dimensions simultaneously, such as time and space or multiple spatial dimensions ($x$, $y$, and $z$).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we only focus on ODEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential equations can also be classified based on their linearity. An ODE is linear if the unknown function and its derivatives appear only to the first power and are not multiplied by each other. If the functions and/or derivatives are raised to a power other than one or are multiplied by each other, the ODE is nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Examples of linear ODEs:*\n",
    "    * $f''(x) + 2f'(x) + f(x) = 0$ $\\newline$\n",

    "    * $f'(x) = \\cos(f(x))$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Order of Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of a differential equation is determined by the *highest derivative* present in the equation. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *First order* (the highest derivative is first): $\\newline$\n",
    "    * $\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = 3t + 2$ $\\newline$\n",

    "    * $\\dfrac{d^2y}{dt^2}+ 2 \\dfrac{dy}{dt}+y = 0$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 1.4. Initial Value Problem   \n",
    "\n",
    "An Initial Value Problem (IVP) is a specific type of differential equation that includes initial conditions. These initial conditions provide the starting values for the unknown function and its derivatives at a particular point. An example of an initial condition could be a known value of the function at $t=0$, $y_0$. Solving an IVP involves finding a function that satisfies the given differential equation and also aligns with the initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Solution:** The general solution of a differential equation represents the family of all possible solutions without specifying particular values for any arbitrary constants that may arise during the solving process. For example, for the differential equation $y' = y$, we need to find a function such that its first derivative is equal to the function itself. An obvious solution in this case is $y = C e^t$, where $C$ is some arbitrary constant. This solution is known as a general solution because it involves an arbitrary constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Particular Solution:** A particular solution is derived from the general solution by assigning particular values to the arbitrary constants based on additional information, such as initial conditions. For instance if we know that $y(t=0)=y_0=5$, then substituting the initial condition into the general solution $y = C e^t$, gives $5=C e^0$ implying $C=5$. Hence, the particular solution is $y= 5 e^t$. This solution satisfies both the differential equation $y'=y$ as well as the initial condition $y_0=5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will explore various numerical methods for approximating the solutions to initial value problems. While IVPs may involve more than just differential equations in time, we will predominantly focus on time as the independent variable for simplicity. Additionally, we will utilize different notations for the unknown function and its derivatives, adapting them based on the specific context, as previously mentioned."

    "The primary objective when dealing with differential equations is to determine the unknown function $y$ that satisfies the relationship between the function itself and its derivatives. An analytic solution is a mathematical function that, when substituted into the differential equation, results in a true statement. For instance, in the previous example $y'=y$, it was easy to find an analytic solution: $y=5e^t$. If an analytic solution exists, there is no need to use any of the numerical techniques we will discuss. However, obtaining analytic solutions for many differential equations is often challenging or impossible, making numerical methods necessary. Therefore, we focus on finding approximate numerical solutions. But what exactly is a *numerical solution*?\n",
    "\n",
    "A numerical solution involves computing a sequence of approximate values for the unknown function at various points in time or space. For instance, a numerical solution might consist of $y(t=0)=5$, $y(t=0.2)=6$, $y(t=0.4)=7.2$, $y(t=0.6)=8.6$, and so on. It is called a numerical solution because it consists of numbers rather than a mathematical expression. Typically, the numerical solution is visualized, and by estimating the solution at small intervals, the numeric results effectively resemble a function.\n",

    "# 3. Error in Numerical Solutions <a id=\"s3\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to numerical differentiation and integration, numerical solutions to differential equations are also subject to errors. Understanding the accuracy of these methods and the magnitude of the error is crucial for their reliable application. Mathematically, the error in numerical solutions refers to the difference between the exact solution at a time step and the approximated numerical solution at that time step. The error is mainly caused by the assumptions used in numerical methods, specifically, assuming a linear function between two successive time steps and approximating the value of the slope of that function using the derivative at one or multiple points.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the step size $h$ decreases, the numerical results tend to converge to the true values of the function that satisfies the differential equation. However, even with the same step size $h$, different numerical methods exhibit different levels of accuracy. Theoretically, methods that evaluate the slope at the midpoint of the interval and those that use multiple points to approximate the slope are more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1. Order of Error\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the exact error is generally not possible, as this requires knowing the true value of the function, which is usually unknown in real applications. Instead, we estimate the order or magnitude of the error using Big-O notation as a function of the step size $h$. The table below summarizes the order of the error associated with various numerical integration methods:\n",

    "| RK4 Method      | $\\mathcal{O}\\left(h^4\\right)$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are focusing on small values of $h$, higher-order methods, for which the exponent $k$ in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(h^k\\right)$ is larger, tend to have smaller error and thus are more accurate (since for small values of $h$ like 0.01, $h^2$ will be smaller, $h^4$ even smaller than that, and so on, making higher-order methods more accurate for small step sizes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2. Error and Spacing Trade-off \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to numerical differentiation and integration, choosing a smaller step size $h$ improves the accuracy of numerical solution for differential equations. However, this increased accuracy comes at the cost of greater computational demands, including longer processing times and higher memory requirements, as well as potentially more significant round-off errors. When subdividing the solution domain $[t_0, t_f]$ into $N$ subintervals each with step size $h$, increasing $N$ or equivalently decreasing $h$, increases the number of values $y_i$ that must be computed. This added complexity leads to longer computation times. Therefore, a balance between acceptable error and step size is crucial.\n",
