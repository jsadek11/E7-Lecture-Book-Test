    "# 4. Common Use Cases <a id=\"s4\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are fundamental in programming as they allow for decision-making in code. Below are some common use cases of conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1. Compare Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are often used to direct the flow of a program by comparing value of a variable against some other value or variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> weather == 🌫️\n",
    ">>> if weather == 🌧️:\n",
    "...     print(\"Don't forget to take an ☔.\")\n",
    "... elif weather == ☀️:\n",
    "...     print(\"It's a great day for a walk 🌞!\")\n",
    "... else:\n",
    "...     print(\"Stay prepared for any weather 🌦️🤔.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "Stay prepared for any weather 🌦️🤔.\n",
    "```\n",
    "## 4.2. Check For Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Membership operators (e.g. `in` or `not in`) are also used to write conditional statements to check whether certain values are contained within a data structure, such as a `list`, `str` or other collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> prohibited_items = [🔪, ✂️, 🎆, 🔥]\n",
    ">>> item = 🪥\n",
    ">>> if item in prohibited_items:\n",
    "...     print(f\"🚫 Prohibited item found: {item}. Please remove it from your bag.\")\n",

    "```\n",
    "## 4.3. Check Object Type\n",

    "Conditional statements are also used to validate data type, ensuring a variable meets certain criteria before proceeding. A useful function to check the data type of an object is the `isinstance()` function, which has the following syntax:\n",

    "# 5. Nested If Statements <a id=\"s5\"></a>\n",

    "# subsequent code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the inner `if` statement is nested within the outer `if` statement, both condition_1 and condition_2 should be `True` for the innermost code block 2 to execute. This means that even if condition_2 is `True` but condition_1 is `False`, code block 2 will not be executed. In addition, the inner `if` statement must be indented further than the outer `if` statement to indicate that it is part of the outer `if` block. Proper indentation is crucial for readability and correct program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Notes:\n",
    "* The inner `if` statement can also include `elif` and `else` branches to handle multiple conditions\n",
    "* The inner `if` statement can be placed under an `elif` or `else` statement\n",
    "* You can have multiple layers of nested `if` statements, but be mindful of readability and complexity. Excessive nesting can make code difficult to understand and maintain.\n",
