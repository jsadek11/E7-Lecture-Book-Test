    "\n",
    "Calculus focuses on two primary computations: taking derivatives and evaluating definite integrals. We've previously discussed numerical differentiation methods for approximating rates of change. Similarly, quantifying accumulated quantities such as areas, volumes, and energy commonly arise in various engineering and science disciplines. For instance, in environmental science, estimating the total volume of water beneath a lake's surface is essential for effective water resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the accumulation of quantities is modeled using integrals. Just as with derivatives, there exists a comprehensive [set of rules](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/integration-rules.html) for analytically computing integrals. These rules include the fundamental theorem of calculus, integration by substitution, integration by parts, and trigonometric integrals, among others. Despite the long list of available rules, computing integrals for complex functions can be time-consuming. In fact, there are functions for which no closed-form analytical solutions exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, similar to differentiation, only discrete data points are typically available in real-world scenarios and the exact mathematical form of the function may be unknown. In such cases, analytical integration is impossible. This limitation necessitates the use of numerical integration methods, which provide a practical approach to approximating integrals when analytical solutions are impractical or unavailable. These methods allow us to estimate the area under a function based on available data points, thus playing a pivotal role across various fields and applications.\n",
