    "Most programming languages, such as Java and C++, use a fixed number of bits to store integers, typically 32 bits (though shorter and longer integer types can be declared). In this fixed-size approach, the largest integer that can be stored using a signed 32-bit integer is: $2^{32-1}-1=2,147,483,647$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a fixed number of bits to represent integers, there will be a limit on the largest number that can be represented. When an operation generates a number that exceeds this limit, it results in a phenomenon known as **overflow**. Overflow leads to unpredictable behavior in computer responses. For example, attempting to assign the number $2,147,483,648$ to a 32-bit signed integer would cause overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In 2014, Google faced the overflow issue when the video \"Gangnam Style\" was viewed more than 2,147,483,647 times, exceeding the limit of 32-bit integers. To address this, Google switched to using 64-bit integers to count views on videos, allowing for much larger view counts.\n",

However, the velocity was being converted to a 16-bit integer for further processing in the navigation software. In the initial stages of the flight, when the rocket's acceleration was moderate, the velocity conversion proceeded without issue. However, as the rocket's velocity increased dramatically with acceleration, it exceeded the maximum value representable by a 16-bit integer. This overflow error led to the failure of the navigation system, resulting in the loss of the rocket and its payload.\n",

IEEE 754 tackles this challenge by allocating higher precision to smaller numbers and lower precision to larger ones. As a consequence, a greater proportion of representable numbers cluster near zero, where precision is most critical. While this allocation strategy may pose challenges if not carefully considered, the relatively minor spacing gap at larger magnitudes is typically acceptable given the overall scale of the numbers involved.\n",
