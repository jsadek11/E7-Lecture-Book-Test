    "While Python's built-in data structures like lists and tuples are versatile, they may not always provide the performance and efficiency required for complex numerical computations, especially when dealing with large datasets or multidimensional arrays. This is where NumPy comes into play. NumPy, short for \"Numerical Python\", is one of the most used modules for scientific and numerical applications. NumPy is a large and extensive module, and this section is just a brief introduction. In addition to performance benefits, NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions for array manipulation, linear algebra, and more. These functions are optimized for efficiency and are essential for various scientific and engineering applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create 1-D and 2-D arrays using different methods\n",
    "* Access individual elements and slices of arrays using indexing and slicing techniques\n",
    "* Modify elements and slices of arrays\n",
    "* Perform arithmetic and comparison operations on arrays\n",
    "* Use advanced indexing methods like boolean indexing to access and modify array elements"

So, the items are put inside square brackets `np.array([...])` or a second set of parentheses `np.array((...))`, and are separated by commas `,`.\n",

Instead of giving the values of the indexes, a logical expression can be used directly to filter the elements of the array.\n",
