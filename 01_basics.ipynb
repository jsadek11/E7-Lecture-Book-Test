    "\n",
    "Effective computation requires understanding how data are stored and manipulated. Python offers a variety of built-in *symbols* that can be used to perform operations, such as addition, comparison, and logical evaluations, among others. These symbols are known as **operators**. For example, `+` symbol is the addition operator. In this section, we will introduce the fundamentals of the Python Programming language, including different operators and the operations they facilitate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform arithmetic operations using Python operators\n",
    "* Import and use functions and constants from different modules\n",
    "* Identify and distinguish between scalar data types in Python\n",
    "* Understand how Python automatically assigns data types and perform explicit type conversion using built-in functions\n",
    "* Use the `type()` function to check the type of an object\n",
    "* Use variables and the assignment operator in computations\n",
    "* Apply the rules and conventions for naming variables in Python\n",
    "* Use comparison operators and logical operators to create logical expressions for evaluating conditions \n",
    "* Apply the order of operations and operators to correctly evaluate complex expressions in Python\n",
